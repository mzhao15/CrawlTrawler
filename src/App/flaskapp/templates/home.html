			<p>Analyzing the statistics of the users' visits to the websites of companies
				has been a common tool to understand customers' insterests and trend of
				products. However, the weblog files and pageview information often
				include inforation from web crawlers which can mislead companies to
				draw wrong conclusions and thus make wrong decisions. This insight project
				aims to help companies identify and filter the fake information, and thus
				precisely analyze their customers' behaviors.
			<p>
			<p>This project uses the logfiles (millions of visits per day) from
				<a href="https://www.sec.gov/">sec.org</a>, but can be extended to other websites
				such as e-commerce, digital media and so on, which has larger volume of visits.
			</p>
			<p>This pipeline has been optimized so that the batch processing can be completed
				within a short time.
